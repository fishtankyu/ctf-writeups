There are few option to choose from but when we tried to choose the option 5 (cd <dirname>) it seems it doesnâ€™t work at all.

However something is interesting, which is option 2 cat ./name
I google search and found this, which means we can cat multiple files although they are from different directory

Execute!
  
I tried:
qwe ; cat /home/ctf/Xxp80wAmE2bfwc3LYwvPelKScG2TAczo/flag.txt
qwe ; cat /home/ctf/flags.txt
qwe ; cat /home/ctf/flag.txt (This work!)
